                <h2>The Backstory</h2>
                <p>C++ is a very powerful programming language. In our studies, we learned this language from its basics, such as primitive types and basic functions, to more advanced features, like sorting algorithms and recursive functions.</p>
                <p>During these studies, however,we found that some of the more advanced functions, algorithms, and containers were much harder to visualize and learn. Reading the reference material often left us with more questions than it answered. And from our struggles, the idea for this website was born.</p>

                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>The mission and purpose of this website is to help people learn some of the trickier bits of the language, as well as to provide a slightly different way of looking at C++ as a whole.</p>
                <p>The Containers page contains a window that a user can interact with. It allows the user to see how different functions work with different container types. As opposed to a regular text editor and compiler, any function applied to the container will change or mutate it instantaneously.</p>
                <p>The Algorithms page provides the user with a list of some of the most important and useful algorithms. Just like the Containers page, the algorithms are interactive, to better show the user how they work.</p>
